Oracle IDM 11g R2 PS2 Automated Deployment Tool
===============================================

The new Deployment Tool for Oracle IDM 11g R2 automates the installation and configuration of specific Oracle IDAM. I have used installation of Oracle Identity Manager 11g R2 PS2 as a use case to demonstrate usage of the Automated Deployment Tool. One can also install Oracle Access Manager in a standalone mode or in an integrated fashion with OIM with the help of this tool.
